## 🤺 1. The Winning Formula: A Fencing Case Study
**Timeline:** March 2025 – May 2025  
**Tech Stack:** R, Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Ensemble Methods

### Project Overview
This project focused on isolating the variables that influence net points in fencing competitions. The goal was to determine whether parametric or non-parametric approaches yield better predictive performance for athletic success.

### Key Methodologies
* **Multivariate Analysis:** Conducted a comparative analysis between parametric methods (Linear & Stepwise Regression) and non-parametric methods (Regression Trees & Ensembles).
* **Validation Strategy:** Implemented $k$-fold cross-validation to rigorously validate model performance, minimizing overfitting and ensuring the predictors identified were robust to new data.

## 🎵 2. From Words to Movement: NLP & Lyrical Analysis
**Timeline:** September 2025 – December 2025  
**Tech Stack:** Python (NLP), Feature Engineering, Statistical Testing

### Project Overview
An exploration of the relationship between lyrical structure and song popularity/danceability. This project utilized a text corpus of Billboard top hits spanning 2000–2024.

### Key Methodologies
* **Feature Engineering:** Engineered a novel feature, `repetition_ratio`, by applying Natural Language Processing techniques to quantify lyrical repetitiveness.
* **Hypothesis Testing:** Established a statistically significant correlation between `repetition_ratio` and song "danceability," challenging baseline models that relied solely on audio features.

## 👗 3. The Fashion Formula: Understanding What Drives Zara Sales
**Timeline:** September 2025 – December 2025  
**Tech Stack:** Econometrics, Box-Cox Transformation, Stepwise Selection

### Project Overview
A deep dive into retail analytics, diagnosing the key drivers of sales volume for Zara using rigorous econometric modeling techniques.

### Key Methodologies
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed extensive EDA to identify initial patterns and outliers in sales data.
* **Model Optimization:** Constructed a high-precision regression model utilizing Box-Cox transformations to resolve non-normality issues.
* **Feature Selection:** Applied BIC-based (Bayesian Information Criterion) stepwise selection to optimize feature usage without over-complicating the model.
